# lichee is available at 
# https://github.com/viq854/lichee

gh repo clone viq854/lichee

no environment required for this, it runs in java

wrote lichee_tests.py to test its ability to run

couldn't get it to run, can return to it later and see why perhaps. It hasn't been updated for 7 years so perhaps it isn't worthwhile
